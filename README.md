# CIS 565 Performance Lab

This is the second in series of 2 labs for CUDA. In this lab, we will discuss
how NVIDIA's Nsight for Visual Studio and Visual Profiler can aid in debugging
CUDA programs.

**The performance lab will be held in class.**
**Please bring your Windows CUDA-Capable laptop with the code downloaded and built.**
**If you do not have a Windows CUDA-Capable laptop, please find a partner to work with.**

## Clone, Build and Run
The source code consists of a CMake build structure similar to [Project 0](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2017/Project0-CUDA-Getting-Started).
Clone this repository from Github and then run the instructions below.

1. In Git Bash, navigate to your cloned project directory.
2. Create a `build` directory: `mkdir build`
   * (This "out-of-source" build makes it easy to delete the `build` directory
     and try again if something goes wrong with the configuration.)
3. Navigate into that directory: `cd build`
4. Open the CMake GUI to configure the project:
   * `cmake-gui ..` or `"C:\Program Files (x86)\cmake\bin\cmake-gui.exe" ..`
     * Don't forget the `..` part!
   * Click *Configure*.  Select your version of Visual Studio, Win64.
     (**NOTE:** you must use Win64, as we don't provide libraries for Win32.)
   * If you see an error like `CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR-NOTFOUND`,
     set `CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR` to your CUDA install path. This will be something
     like: `C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v8.0`
   * Click *Generate*.
5. If generation was successful, there should now be a Visual Studio solution
   (`.sln`) file in the `build` directory that you just created. Open this.
   (from the command line: `explorer *.sln`)
6. Build. (Note that there are Debug and Release configuration options.)
7. Run. Make sure you run the `transpose` target (not `ALL_BUILD`) by
   right-clicking it and selecting "Set as StartUp Project".
   * If you have switchable graphics (NVIDIA Optimus), you may need to force
     your program to run with only the NVIDIA card. In NVIDIA Control Panel,
     under "Manage 3D Settings," set "Multi-display/Mixed GPU acceleration"
     to "Single display performance mode".

Please ask me or the TAs ahead of time if you have trouble compiling the code. We want to be ready to go at the start of the lab.
